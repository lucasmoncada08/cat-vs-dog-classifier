# cat-vs-dog-classifier
Using convolutional neural networks to develop a model that classifies whether an image is a cat or a dog

This mini-project was to experiment with computer vision problems. Specifically, using CNNs to develop classifiers for image datasets. The dataset was downloaded from the kaggle cats vs dogs competition that can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data.
